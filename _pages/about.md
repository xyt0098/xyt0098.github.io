My name is Yitao Xu (徐一涛). Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a exchange master's student in Computer Science at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Before the exchange semester, I was a master's student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), majoring in Machine Learning. 

Before my master's study, I got my B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Beihang University (BUAA)](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). I worked as a research student at [State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment (NLSDE)](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/), advised by [Prof.Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/), and I also finished my bachelor's thesis project focusing on rectifying texture bias exposed in deep neural network under the supervision of [Prof.Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). After graduating from BUAA, I become a Machine Learning Intern at [DiDi AI Labs](https://www.didiglobal.com/science/ailabs), where I was led by [Zhengping Che](https://chezhengping.xyz/) and [Prof.Jian Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IirM9zMAAAAJ&hl=en-en). Beginning in 12.2020, I spent a wonderful winter at [Tsinghua Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence (THBI)](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) under the supervision of [Prof.Jia Liu](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1010/1010.htm), studying intuitive physics engine and stability inference with convolutional neural networks. 

I'm interested in building reliable and interpretable computer vision models and study the similarity between those models and humans. Particularly, I focus on:
- Neural cellular automata and self-organizing systems
- Interpretability of adversarial attacks and adversarial robustness
- Different cognition biases between humans and deep-learning based computer vision models

I believe studying bio-inspired models and investigating the difference between humans and machines can help us achieve silicon-based artificial human intelligence!
